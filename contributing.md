## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Guidelines

- *Styling*
  - Use TailwindCSS utility classes exclusively.
  - Avoid traditional CSS or inline styles.

- *Conditional Classes*
  - Prefer class: directive over ternary operators for conditional classes.

- *Naming Conventions*
  - Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
  - Prefix event handlers with handle, e.g., handleClick.

- *Accessibility*
  - Ensure interactive elements have:
    - tabIndex="0"
    - aria-label
    - onClick and onKeyDown handlers.

- *Function Declarations*
  - Use arrow functions assigned to constants:
    typescript
    const toggle = (): void => { ... };
    
  - Define types explicitly where possible.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Backend Guidelines

- *API Routes*
  - Use TypeScript with precise typings for requests and responses.
  - Validate inputs using tools like Zod.
  - Return structured JSON responses:
    typescript
    return NextResponse.json({ success: true, data });
    
  - Avoid direct use of res.status() or res.json(); prefer NextResponse.

- *Database (PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM)*
  - Use descriptive table and column names.
  - Interact with the database through Drizzle ORM.
  - Handle database errors gracefully and log them appropriately.

- *Authentication & Security*
  - Do not expose sensitive data to the frontend.
  - Protect private routes using session checks.
  - Store session tokens securely, avoiding localStorage.

- *Error Handling*
  - Implement try/catch blocks with meaningful error messages.
  - Return informative error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.

- *Performance Best Practices*
  - Use async/await consistently; avoid mixing with .then().
  - Optimize database queries to prevent unnecessary calls.
  - Implement caching strategies where applicable.
